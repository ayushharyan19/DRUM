This is an interactive web-based Drum Kit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each drum sound can be played either by clicking the drum icons or by pressing the assigned keyboard keys (Q–F and 1–7). The interface includes responsive drum cards with glow and animation effects to enhance the user experience. JavaScript handles audio playback, key detection, and visual effects, while CSS provides a modern gradient-based UI.
This project demonstrates skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, keyboard input, and web audio integration.
